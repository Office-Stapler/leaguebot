# LeagueBot

## About
  - Leaguebot is just a simple discord bot which utilises Riot Game's API and data to scrape information about players and champions.
  It explores the provided data file in order to supply champion information such as skins, abilities and icons as well base stats.
  I plan to implement web scraping for players/summoners that'll give data about the player in with only their name.
